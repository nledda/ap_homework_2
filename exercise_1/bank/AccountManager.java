Write methods to:

• class AccountManager in the same package.
• class ExternalAudit in a different package.
• class CompanyAccount in a different package that inherits from Account.
Try accessing all four attributes from all three classes.
• Explain which accesses fail and why.
• Suggest alternative designs (e.g., getters).
• What is the difference between using protected vs. using private and providing a getter for subclasses to access an instance variable?
